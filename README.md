# Traffic_Management_system
Developed an AI-based traffic violation detection system using Python, YOLOv9, and OpenCV

This project is an AI-based traffic violation detection system developed using Python, YOLOv9, and OpenCV. It aims to automatically detect and identify traffic violations in real-time.

Main Function Points
Utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect and classify traffic violations
Processes video streams or images to identify vehicles, pedestrians, and other objects
Applies YOLOv9 object detection model to identify and classify traffic violations
Provides a system for monitoring and reporting traffic violations
Technology Stack
Python programming language
YOLOv9 (You Only Look Once) object detection model
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) for image and video processing
Numpy and other supporting libraries
